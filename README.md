# term_mux_rs (working title, I don't like it, see [#1](https://github.com/mdevlamynck/term_mux_rs/issues/1))

Terminal multiplexer in rust

This project only supports GNU/Linux at the moment. Redox, macOS and Windows support may happen in the future (in that order of priority).

# Hacking

As any rust project, use `cargo` to build, run the project, run the tests or build the docs.

```sh
cargo build      # compile
cargo run        # launch term_mux
cargo test       # run tests
cargo doc        # build the docs
cargo doc --open # build the docs and open them in your browser
```
